    "This notebook serves as an example for the process of the analysis of semantic similarity. Semantic similarity requires not simply comparing text, but comparing what the text is supposed to mean. Even people can have disagreements over this, so computing something that abstract is a complex task.\n",
    "\n",
    "A concept of vital importance is text embedding. Text is relatively hard to compare; comparing numbers is significantly faster than comparing strings, the latter possibly requiring iterating over each character to check it. Transforming the text into a numerical representation brings a lot of efficiency, and is an important first step. There are multiple ways to go about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way is called \\textit{bag of words}. The entire vocabulary of the library of text we want to compare is numerically allocated; each word is given an entry in a simple lookup table. A sentence can then be vectorized, each vector being the same length as the lookup table, and each index holding the count of how often the word assigned that number appears in the sentence. Comparing these vectors then essentially compares the overlap between words used in sentences, assuming that the same words lead to the same meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, as the 'bag' implies, we lose order, a very important part of semantic meaning. Additionally, words may be functionally similar, but be different counts; two sentences each using different synonyms would be very different in this theory. 'Greater' could be stemmed to 'great', but the same is harder for 'better' and 'good'. What about 'terrific' and 'great'? We could look up synonyms for each word, but this quickly becomes very inefficient."
